YUMI

Your universal Multiboot Installer

YUMI is a "create-boot-usb-sticks" for windows, which supports dozens of linux distros and automatically downloads the isos for you.

After YUMI has put an OS on it, the usb stick is still usable to store files and everything else.

This is why I like this software and created this repo.

There is a Windows version and a Linux version. (The Linux version is not part of this repo, and was written in gambas, a visual-basic-for-linux language.)

It turns out the Windows version consists of .nsh files which belong to the "Nullsoft Scriptable Installer System".


Notes

Yumi is free software (GPL 3.0).

There seems to be no official Git repo, only the source code in a zip file. This is why I created this unofficial repo.
