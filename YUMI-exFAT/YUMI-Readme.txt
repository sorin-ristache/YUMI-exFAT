Background of YUMI:

YUMI is an easy to use Multiboot script created using NSIS. YUMI's purpose is to help automate the creation of a bootable USB Flash Drive that can be used to boot multiple Linux based distributions (one at a time).
The end result should be a bootable USB Flash drive that will get you up and running with your chosen Live Distributions, all without having to do the research and perform the steps by hand. 

How YUMI exFAT Works:

YUMI exFAT utilizes a separate self contained build of YUMI2USB based on Ventoy/Ventoy2Disk to make the chosen exFAT formatted USB drive bootable for UEFI and Legacy BIOS booting. 
ISO files are organized by type and copied to the YUMI folder and categorized subdirectories on the USB device. 
For example; Linux-ISOS, System-Tools, Windows-Installers, Antivirus-Tools, etc.
